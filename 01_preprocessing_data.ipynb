The exhibition provided visitors with information on the National Assembly . On 1 March 2010 , the building was again reopened to the public as a Welsh history museum and exhibition .

       "The Pierhead Building was opened in 1897 and designed by William Frame . It was originally the headquarters of the Bute Dock Company and by 1947 it was the administrative office for the Port of Cardiff . The building was reopened in May 2001 as ' The Assembly at the Pierhead ' , which was a visitor and education centre for the National Assembly . The exhibition provided visitors with information on the National Assembly . On 1 March 2010 , the building was again reopened to the public as a Welsh history museum and exhibition . In 2008 , Elis @-@ Thomas announced that the Pierhead Building would display the history of the black community in Butetown , Cardiff Docks and Welsh devolution . \\n       1\n",
